Users, Sharing & Collaboration
1. How do I share the reports in Zoho Analytics with my colleagues?
You can share the default reports provided in the Zoho BugTracker Connector add-on and the reports you have create, with other users in your portal. Refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page for more details on this.
Once you privately share a report to your colleagues they will be able to access the reports as you do. Refer here to know how to access the reports.
Note:
1. If you share the data tables in the Zoho BugTracker Workspace to users, they will be able to create their own reports over the same.
2. If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the Zoho BugTracker Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
3. You can share data tables and reports to any user. They need not be a user in our portal.
2. Why are other members in my Portal not able to access the reports created?
By default only the Portal Owner or Administrator who configures the Zoho BugTracker Connector will be able to access the views (tables, reports and dashboards) in Zoho Analytics. The Administrator has to explicitly share the view with other users. The shared user will be able to access the view with the specific permission that the Administrator has granted.
Also when the Administrator has shared a table, then the shared users can create reports over them and these reports will be available only to them, until they share the reports with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my Portal create reports?
The Administrator (or Portal Owner) who configures the Zoho BugTracker Connector should share the data tables present in Zoho BugTracker Workspace with other members. Once this is done, the shared users can create reports based over these data tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
Note: If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator, then the user will be able access all the data & reports, and create new reports in the Workspace. A Workspace Administrator can to add, delete, and modify reports, table rows and tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the database tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a database.

4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics supports fine-grained access control. The following are user roles that are supported in Zoho Analytics:
1. Administrator (Master Admin): The Zoho BugTracker Portal Owner or Administrator who had setup the add-on will be the administrator of the Zoho Analytics account.
2. Workspace Administrator: The Administrator can designate one or more users as Workspace Administrators. A Workspace Administrator has all permissions to add, delete, and modify reports, table rows and even tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the database tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a database.
3. User: A user has the least privilege in the hierarchy. Unless the Administrator or a Workspace Administrator shares a table with a user, the user cannot create any reports on his/her own. Also, an Administrator/Workspace Administrator can decide to set specific permissions when sharing a report (Read Only, Export Data, View Underlying Data, and Share with Others) or a table (Read Data, Export Data, Add/Delete/Modify Row, Delete All Rows, Only Append Rows, Add or Update Rows, Delete All Rows and Add New Rows, Share View / Child Reports)

5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
