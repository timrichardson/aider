Logo Rebranding
You as the Administrator of the Zoho Analytics account can replace the Zoho Analytics logo appearing on the Home page with your own logo using this option. You can also specify the URL of the page you want to visit when you click on the new logo.
Zoho Analytics also allows you to customize the 'Powered by Logo' that appears in the footer (of the report/dashboard) when you embed or export the report.
Logo Rebranding is supported only in the Premium and Enterprise plans of Zoho Analytics.
