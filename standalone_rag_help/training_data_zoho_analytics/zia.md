Ask Zia
Amidst the millions of the raw data, lies a huge business opportunity. Bringing out hidden insight is a big challenge. This is where Ask Zia comes in.
Zia, Zoho's smart and Intelligent Assistant based on machine learning (ML) and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, is now part of Zoho Analytics. Ask Zia provides the capability to ask questions in natural language and get powerful insights quickly.
Ask Zia is driven by natural language processing (NLP). It understands your questions asked in plain English, and gets you powerful insights as answers in the form of cool and relevant visualizations.
You can simply Ask Zia questions like "What was my sales last month?", "Get me the tasks that need to be completed by today" or "Show me the delayed tickets". It will interpret these questions, fetches data from the relevant tables, and generates the most appropriate reports.
Ask Zia learns the patterns in your question over time, and provides suggestions to frame questions. These suggestions are very personal. This lets you work faster and smarter, and stay ahead in your business.
