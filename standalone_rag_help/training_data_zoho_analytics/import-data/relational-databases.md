You can also automate the import process to synchronize the data from your local /hosted database into Zoho Analytics at periodic intervals.
To provides a hassle-free import experience, Zoho Analytics provides a lightweight independent utility called Zoho Databridge. This bridges your local source and Zoho Analytics server to fetch data from your data source. Zoho Databridge needs to be installed on your premises from where it can access your local source.
