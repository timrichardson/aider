4. How do you define a "User" by Zoho Analytics Pricing model?
Anyone to whom at least one view in the Zoho Analytics account is privately shared is considered a User in the Zoho Analytics pricing model. These private users are required to have an account in Zoho Analytics and they need to login with their user name and password to access the views shared to them in that corresponding Zoho Analytics account. Users are identified by their unique email address, to which the views in Zoho Analytics account is shared.
Account Administrator is also considered as a User. When you subscribe a plan with 5 users, then you an privately share the data/reports in your account with 4 other persons for collaboration. Now your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users (Admin + 4 users).
By adding new users to your account, you could easily collaborate with them. The Administrator has the complete control on who can access the views. The administrator can grant permission to perform operations such as add, modify and delete data, create new reports and share views within a group, apart from just viewing the shared reports. Shared users will be able to perform only the operation that the admin has granted.
5. How is the "Number of rows" stored counted?
The number of rows (records) is the sum of all rows stored across all your workspace in your Zoho Analytics account. i.e., when you have 2 workspaces with 3 tables in each of them. And each table contains 100,000 rows. Then the total number of rows in your Zoho Analytics account is calculated as 600,000 (100,000 rows \* 6 tables).
Note
- Rows that are stored in Zoho Analytics Tables (across all your workspaces) alone will be counted. Data in any other object in Zoho Analytics such as query table and tabular view will not be counted.

2. Any restriction on the size of data files that could be imported from the user interface?
Currently, Zoho Analytics allows you to import files (CSV, TSV, XLS, HTML) with maximum 1000,000 rows or a file size limit of 100 MB at a time when you use the Zoho Analytics web user interface. It will restrict it based on whichever condition is met first. If you wish to upload more than 1000,000 rows or a file more than 100 MB at a time, you can use the Zoho Databridge, as it would be more efficient to handle such loads.
For free and trial versions, Zoho Analytics allows you to have only up to a maximum of 1000,000 rows in a table.
If you find these limits are constraining to your application needs, mail us your requirements to support@zohoanalytics.com, we will definitely help you.

To avoid this, we recommend using Zoho Databridge, a lightweight independent utility that bridges your data source and Zoho Analytics server to enable easy data import. This provides a hassle-free import of large CSV files.
Note: the overall limitation of having a maximum 1,000,000 rows in a table still applies, when you are in the Free or Trial Editions of Zoho Analytics. Please refer #2 for more details on import data size restrictions.

1. Is Zoho Analytics supported on Mobile and Tablet devices?
Yes. Zoho Analytics offers mobile optimized apps for iPhones, Android Phones, iPad, and Android Tablets available in the Apple App Store and Google Play Store respectively.
2. What is the difference between Zoho Analytics and Zoho Creator?
The key difference between Zoho Analytics and Zoho Creator is in-depth reporting and analytics vs online custom database application creation.
Zoho Analytics enables you to easily create powerful and sophisticated reports with your data by creating online reporting applications. It enables you to slice & dice your data for in-depth visualization and business intelligence. Zoho Creator enables you to quickly create a powerful online database application to collect data and trigger work flows through forms and scripting.
Zoho Analytics could act as a convenient back-end reporting/analytical service for your application needs. You can get data into Zoho Analytics through manual data entry or bulk load data from files or upload data stored in your local databases (like MS Access, Oracle, SQL Server, MySQL, DB2, PostgreSQL & MS Access) or schedule for periodic upload of data or push data from your application through Web API (HTTP based) for reporting and analysis. Here the crucial difference is that, while Zoho Creator offers a hosted programming environment (with a DB backing), Zoho Analytics offers a powerful reporting layer for your application data.
Zoho Analytics also supports full-fledged relational modeling (similar to relational/analytical databases) for powerful reporting. It currently supports relational modeling functionalities through Lookup columns. With lookup columns you can relate one table with another. It also offers cascade-on-delete functionality whereby when a row in the parent table is deleted, it will automatically delete all the related rows in the child table(s). Click to know more on Zoho Analytics Relational Modeling Capabilities.
The other key difference is that Zoho Analytics embraces SQL, and supports all major dialects of it. This enables users to do sophisticated querying on the data for creating powerful reports. We will flesh out this functionality even further in future updates.
3. How to choose between Zoho Analytics and Zoho Creator?
Please read the FAQ #2 before you read further. If you require a quick application development environment, with forms, scripting, workflows and basic reporting, opt for Zoho Creator. If you require a powerful online reporting and analytics service with an inbuilt analytical database support, opt for Zoho Analytics. Zoho Analytics also supports Web based APIs using which you can build your own forms and push/update/pull data into Zoho Analytics from any of your applications.
