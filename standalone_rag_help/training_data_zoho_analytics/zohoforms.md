3. There are a few data mismatches between my data available on Zoho Forms and Zoho Analytics. What could be the possible reasons?
Case 1: Zoho Forms - Zoho Sheet
Any new entries made in Zoho Forms will be immediately added to Zoho Sheet. However, any data changes made to existing rows, such as editing or deleting row, in Zoho Forms will not be synced with Zoho Sheet. This might cause data mismatch between Zoho Forms and Zoho Sheet.
Case 2: Zoho Sheet - Zoho Analytics
There is no direct connection between Zoho Forms and Zoho Analytics. All the data sync is via Zoho Sheet. Any data changes made in Zoho Sheet (it is possible to edit the Zoho Forms data in Zoho Sheet), will be reflected in Zoho Analytics. This could also cause a data mismatch between Zoho Forms and Zoho Analytics.
