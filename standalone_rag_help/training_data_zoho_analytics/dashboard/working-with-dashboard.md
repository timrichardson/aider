Working with Dashboard
Zoho Analytics offers a wide range of interactive options for dashboards when accessed by an end-user. The options include Viewing Underlying data, sorting, exporting, sharing and publishing. In this section, we will discuss each of the below-mentioned options in detail.
Interactions with Dashboards
Dashboards enables you to do exploratory analysis using immersive and interactive features. In this section, we are going to learn about the advanced interactive features such as View Underlying Data, Drill down and Change Chart Type.
Note
All these capabilities are available in the View Mode only.
View Underlying Data
Users of a dashboard can view the underlying data of a report in the dashboard.
To view the underlying data of a chart,

Alternatively, you can also view the entire underlying data of the report by clicking the More option and selecting View Underlying Data.
Drill Down
The Drill Down option allows you to perform powerful exploratory analysis. Using this feature, you can click on any data point in a chart and visualize the underlying data as a chart. You can either drill down using the path that is already set for the chart or choose from the list of compatible columns suggested by Zoho Analytics. Click to learn more about the drill down option.
To drill down a chart,
- Click the data point that you wish to drill-down.

- In this example, we are going to see how to drill down a chart using the Drill Down By option.
