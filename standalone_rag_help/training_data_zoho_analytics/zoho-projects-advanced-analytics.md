Yes, we do provide a 15-day free trial for this connector from the date of setup.
3. What do you mean by 'Users' in the (connector) pricing plan?
Anyone to whom you privately share your databases, tables (data), reports and dashboards, created in Zoho Analytics, for collaboration is considered a "User" in Zoho Analytics. Users are identified by their unique email address, with which their Zoho Analytics account was created/registered.
Let's say that you have subscribed to the Zoho Analytics Standard plan, you can privately share the data/reports in your account and collaborate with 4 other persons. Now, your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users (including yourself). You can also purchase additional users and rows as required. Purchasing additional users is available only on paying plans.
4. What do you mean by 'Rows' and how is it calculated in the pricing plan?
In Zoho Analytics, a row or record is defined in the same context as in a database (or spreadsheet). In simple terms, a table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row in a table represents a set of related data and has the same structure. For example, in a table that represents "Tasks", each row would represent a single task record. The number of rows calculated for pricing, is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your database tables in your Zoho Analytics account.

You can also add your own formulas to derive your own calculations. Do refer to Adding Formulas in Zoho Analytics help page.
8. How do I create my own custom formulas in Zoho Analytics?
Refer to the Adding Formulas in Zoho Analytics help page.
9. Can I add/modify data in the Zoho Projects data tables (modules) from within Zoho Analytics?
No, you cannot add modify data in Zoho Projects data tables. Data from Zoho Projects modules gets automatically synched into Zoho Analytics in the different tables (one table for one module). You cannot edit any of this data or add new data records from within Zoho Analytics.
However you can add new tables and add/import data into that, to create reports combining it with the data from Zoho Projects. Refer #10 below
10. Can I add new columns to the Zoho Projects data tables (modules) from within Zoho Analytics?
No, you cannot add new columns. But, you can add Formula Columns and Aggregate Formulas (i.e., calculated fields) to these tables to help you create powerful reports. Refer Adding Formulas to know more on this.
11. Can I add new data tables in this Workspace to create reports & dashboards?
Yes, you can add new data tables. Click Create > New Table/Import Data to add a new table in the existing Zoho Projects Workspace.
With this feature, you can import data from other sources or add them manually into your Workspace to analyze and create reports combining this with your Zoho Projects data. You can import data from files like CSV, Excel, HTML, JSON, Google Drive etc., or import data from local databases like Oracle, SQL Server, DB2, MySQL, PostgreSQL, MS Access etc., You can also use Zoho Analytics API to develop an application for data upload into Zoho Analytics.
Refer:
- Import data from files
- Import data from Web feeds
- Import data from Cloud Storage
- Import data from local databases
- Import data from Cloud databases
- Import data from popular Business Applications
- Import data using Zoho Analytics API
12. Can I combine data from other sources with the data from Zoho Projects to create reports and dashboards?
Yes, you can combine data from your other sources with your Zoho Projects data for analysis. For example combine Zoho Projects Task data with your release plan information that you might have stored in Google Drive.
To do this, you need to add/import a new data table into the Zoho Projects Workspace as explained in the previous question and then define a look-up to join it with the synchronized table from Zoho Projects. To know how to define a look-up column and auto-join tables for reporting, refer here.
13. What are Query Tables?
Zoho Analytics allow you to pull the data required by writing standard SQL SELECT Queries. This is called Query Tables. With Query Tables you can also combine data from different tables and create reports over the same. View this demo video to know about how to create Query Tables in Zoho Analytics.
14. Can I join data from multiple tables to create reports?
Yes, you can combine data from your other sources with your Zoho Projects data for analysis.
To do this, you need to add/import a new data table into the Zoho Projects Workspace and then define a look-up to join it with the synchronized table from Zoho Projects.
To define a lookup relationship between two tables, it is essential that the tables have at least one column which is common between them. Follow the below steps to look up a column from Zoho Projects along with the data from any other source.
- Open the corresponding table, right click the column header and select Change to Lookup Column.
- In the Change to Lookup Column dialog that opens, select the column to look up.
- Click Ok
Please do note that you can create Lookup only to columns in the tables that are not from the same data source.
Users, Sharing & Collaboration
1. How do I share the reports in Zoho Analytics with my colleagues?
You can share the default reports provided in the Zoho Projects connector and the reports you have create, with other users in your portal. Refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page for more details on this.
Once you privately share a report to your colleagues they will be able to access the reports as you do. Refer here to know how to access the reports.
Note:
1. If you share the data tables in the Zoho Projects Workspace to users, they will be able to create their own reports over the same.
2. If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the Zoho Projects Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
3. You can share data tables and reports to any user. They need not be a user in our portal.
2. Why are other members in my Portal not able to access the reports created?
By default only the Portal Owner or Administrator who configures the Zoho Projects Connector will be able to access the views (tables, reports and dashboards) in Zoho Analytics. The Administrator has to explicitly share the view with other users. The shared user will be able to access the view with the specific permission that the Administrator has granted.
Also when the Administrator has shared a table, then the shared users can create reports over them and these reports will be available only to them, until they share the reports with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my Portal create reports?
The Administrator (or Portal Owner) who configures the Zoho Projects Connector should share the data tables present in Zoho Projects Workspace with other members. Once this is done, the shared users can create reports based over these data tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics section, to know how to add Workspace Administrators
4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics supports fine-grained access control. The following are user roles that are supported in Zoho Analytics:
1. Administrator (Master Admin): The Zoho Projects Portal Owner or Administrator who had setup the connector will be the administrator of the Zoho Analytics account.
2. Workspace Administrator: The Administrator can designate one or more users as Workspace Administrators. A Workspace Administrator has all permissions to add, delete, and modify reports, table rows and even tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the database tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a database.
3. User: A user has the least privilege in the hierarchy. Unless the Administrator or a Workspace Administrator shares a table with a user, the user cannot create any reports on his/her own. Also, an Administrator/Workspace Administrator can decide to set specific permissions when sharing a report (Read Only, Export Data, View Underlying Data, and Share with Others) or a table (Read Data, Export Data, Add/Delete/Modify Row, Delete All Rows, Only Append Rows, Add or Update Rows, Delete All Rows and Add New Rows, Share View / Child Reports)
Refer to Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know more about different user roles in Zoho Analytics. Also refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. Only when the users being shared is set as a Workspace Administrators, they can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit report, what he/she can do is to use Save As to save the report in a different name in his account. This report can then be edited.
6. Can I share the same report created to multiple users with different criteria associated, so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to the Sharing section to know how this can be done.
