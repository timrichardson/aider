Dashboard user filters will be applied over all reports in the Dashboard, by default. Sometimes, you want your reports to remain unchanged regardless of the filters applied in your dashboard. For example, if you have a report comparing current and previous year performance, filtering by year will make it lose its purpose.
In Zoho Analytics, you can easily include/exclude the Users Filters from being applied on a specific report using the Apply Dashboard Filters option.
You can also use this option to map the appropriate columns to be used for filtering, in case the user filter and the report are based on different tables.
You can use this option as shown below.
