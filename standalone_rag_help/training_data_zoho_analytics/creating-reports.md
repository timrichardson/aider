Tips for Creating Compelling Reports
Identify the purpose
Data becomes truly valuable only when it is effectively visualized. So, before building a custom report or a visualization, it is important to ascertain what answer is sought from the data. Effective visualization serves as a bridge between raw data and actionable insights.
Ensure Data Quality
High quality data not only facilitates easier analysis but also improves accuracy. Remove duplicate or irrelevant records that can negatively impact the analysis. Rectify structural errors and ensure a standardized format. Use advanced data transformation functions to prepare the data.
Choose the Right Report Type or Visualization
With so many report types available for visualization, choosing the right report is tedious. Selecting an ideal visualization for analysis relies on the properties of the data and the specific information you aim to convey. We have listed the different types of information that can be visualized and the corresponding report types.
- Comparison
Comparison involves evaluating and finding the similarities or differences between entities (metrics and dimensions). This is one of the most fundamental categories in data analysis. Comparison analysis helps spot deviations and understand change over time, like how a particular metric has changed over a period of time. Chart types like line, bar, area, and pivot table are the best-suited report types for this purpose. - Relationship
This involves understanding the relationship between the metrics or variables. Scatter plot and bubble plot can be used based on the variables, and heat maps can be used for visualizing correlation. - Composition
Composition helps understand how individual segments of data contribute to the whole. This is one of the traditionally used visualizations. Chart types like pie charts, tree maps, and stacked bar charts are the best reports for visualizing composition. - Distribution
Distribution helps understand how values of a metric or a variable are spread or distributed across different intervals or categories. Histograms are best suited to visualize the frequency distribution of a single variable across categories and scatter - Flow
Understanding the movement or flow of data through a process or phase is an important category of visualization. For instance, leads to sales conversion and progression of customers in a website. Chart types like Funnel and Sankey are best suited for this purpose.
Keep it simple
Make the Zoho Analytics' reports easy to understand and interpret. Avoid adding too much information to a single report; instead, focus on the key insight you wish to communicate. Maintain a consistent visual style by using the same color scheme, format, and font throughout to create a unified appearance. Include context and interactive elements to assist users in data comprehension.
