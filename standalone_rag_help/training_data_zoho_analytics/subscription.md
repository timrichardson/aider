SSL stands for Secure Socket Layer and is the protocol that's followed to provide security for data communication over any network including the internet. This option encrypts all your data when it is transferred over the Internet, providing a very secure access system.
In Zoho Analytics, all data communications between your browser and our servers can be SSL enabled (even if you are in the Free plan), meaning all data is encrypted when being transferred over the internet. This can be done by checking the option "Use Secure Access" when you login to Zoho Analytics.
You can also verify the secure access by viewing the URL in the browser address bar, where you will see https:// (HTTP Secure) instead of http :// when you access Zoho Analytics.

Pricing Based on Data and Users
1. Is Zoho Analytics priced on the amount of data stored or on the number of users?
Both. Zoho Analytics is priced based on the total number of rows (records) of data you store in your account and the number of users that you subscribe for your account.
2. How is the "Number of rows" stored counted?
The number of rows (records) is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your workspace tables in your Zoho Analytics account. Suppose you have 2 workspaces with 3 tables in each of them. And each table contains say 10,000 rows. The total number of rows in your Zoho Analytics account is calculated as 60,000.
Rows that are stored/present in Zoho Analytics Tables (across all your workspaces) are only counted for accounting and not in any other object in Zoho Analytics.
3. How does the rows count correspond to data size?
As a measure of size, you can assume 1 million simple rows would be equivalent to around 1 GB or more in data size. However, this can vary based on the number of columns and the type of data contained.
4. How do you define a "User" by the Zoho Analytics Pricing model?
Any user to whom you privately share your data, reports, dashboards, and workspaces in your account is considered as a "User" by the Zoho Analytics pricing model. A user is identified by his/her unique email address, with which he/she would have created/registered their Zoho Analytics account.
By adding new Users to your account, you could collaborate with them easily by enabling them to do operations like Add/Modify/Delete data, Create new reports, Share reports within a group, etc., apart from just viewing the reports shared to them. Also, you (Administrator) can completely control Users access and their permissions to handle other operations on your data (tables), reports and Workspaces.
Suppose you buy the Zoho Analytics Standard plan for 5 users. You can privately share the data/reports in your account with 4 other persons (to their Zoho Analytics registered email addresses). Now your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users.
5. Who is defined as the "Account Administrator"?
The one who subscribes to a Zoho Analytics pricing plan using his/her credit card is defined as the 'Account Administrator'. An 'Account Administrator' has full permissions with regard to his/her Zoho Analytics account. He/She can
- Add/Delete Users
- Add/Delete Workspaces
- Add/Delete/Modify data
- Create/Delete/Modify Reports & Dashboards
- Share Reports and Data to Users
- Upgrade/Downgrade their Zoho Analytics account
- And much more...
6. What is the "Multiple Organization Admins" feature about and how does it work?
With this feature, you the 'Account Administrator' can add multiple users as 'Organization Admins' for your account. Organization Administrator can do all operations as Account Administrator, except deleting and renaming an Organization; and adding, activating, and deactivating other Organization Administrators.
This feature is available only from the Standard plan onwards.
7. What is the "Multiple Workspace Admins" feature about and how does it work?
With this feature, you the 'Account Administrator' can add multiple users as 'Workspace Admins' for a Workspace in your account. Workspace Admins can do any operation in a workspace as its administrator, except deleting the Workspace itself. The Account Administrator is the one who creates all the workspaces in an account, so he/she will be the default Workspace Admin.
This feature is available only from the Standard plan onwards.
8. Do you offer bulk pricing packages (with users and rows)?
Yes, we do. Write to sales@zohocorp.com with your exact requirements, and we'll get back to you with a price quote.
Add-on Pricing
1. What are Add-ons? What Add-ons does Zoho Analytics offer?
Add-ons are flexible options provided to users to purchase additional Users and Rows over and above what is offered in their chosen base pricing plan.
Suppose your requirement is for 1 million rows and 7 users. Instead of buying the Premium $145/month plan, you can buy the Standard $60/month plan (5 users) and add 2 other users to it for $8 x 2 = $16. Thus you pay only $60 + $16 = $76 every month. Similarly, you can buy extra rows too.
