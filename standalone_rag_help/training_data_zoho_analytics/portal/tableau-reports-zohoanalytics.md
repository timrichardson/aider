BI Fabric - Unified Portals
Multiple departments in an organization may deploy diverse BI & analytics tools to analyze their data. Studies reveal that 86% of organizations use two or more BI tools.
Zoho Analytics enables you to have a unified portal for your organization's business needs. This helps you collate reports and dashboards from other BI applications like Tableau and Power BI making it easy for C-level executives to make decisions.
The positive aspects of having a unified portal include,
Centralized Accessibility: A unified BI portal promotes a single point of access for all the business insights, thereby eliminating BI silos and helping users consume the relevant information without having to switch through multiple BI platforms and also access the information on the go. It also significantly reduces the time spent managing user permissions.
Increased Efficiency: Working with multiple BI tools means users need to spend a considerable amount of time to get familiarised with each application's interface. With a unified portal, organizations can implement a single, consistent interface that is easy to use and customize it as needed. This helps organizations gain a competitive edge and drive growth through data-driven strategies.
