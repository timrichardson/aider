Geo Charts Basic
1. Who can create a map chart and what do you need?
Any Zoho Analytics user who wishes to visualize geographical data can create this chart. You will need a location-specific data column to create this chart.
2. What kind of data can be visualized in map charts?
If your dataset contains location information (say, country, county, city etc) then you can use map charts to visualize your data. Zoho Analytics will auto-identify the columns types while importing and set the corresponding Geo data type. Currently, Zoho Analytics can auto-identify 5 types of Geodata.
- Continent - If your column contains the names of the continents or their codes.
- Country - If your column contains the names of countries or their codes (alpha 2-code and alpha 3-code).
- County - If your column contains the names of counties .
- State/Province - If your column contains the names of states/provinces.
- City - If your column contains the names of cities.
- Zip Code - If your column contains postal code of locations.
- Latitude and Longitude - If your column contains latitude and longitude of locations Click here to know about the supported DMS formats.
- Airport - If your column contains airport IATA code.
- Geometry column and Custom Geometry column - If your column contain geometric data for spatial table.
3. Will Zoho Analytics automatically identify the Geodata?
Yes. When you import data into Zoho Analytics if your dataset contains a geographical column (continent, country, county, state or city ) it will be automatically set to the corresponding Geo data type.
Names or Codes: If the data contains names of countries, Alpha-2 and Alpha-3 country codes, names of continents, states, cities, districts, counties, or provinces, then the data type of those columns will be automatically identified as geo location.
Latitude and Longitude: If the latitude/longitude column is in Degrees Minutes Seconds (DMS) format, then Zoho Analytics will automatically identify the data type of the column as latitude or longitude; otherwise it will be identified as decimal number.You can change the data type in the Data Preview section during import or from the table using Change Data Type option.
Airport: If the data contains IATA's unique 3-letter code, then the data type of the column will be automatically identified as Airport.
Postal Code: If the data contains postal code information it will be identified as a positive number. You can change the data type in the Data Preview section during import or from the table using Change DataType option.
Note:
Zoho Analytics will not identify the columns as geo location:
- If there are spelling errors in the location's name. In this case, you can use the Find and Replace option or use Zoho DataPrep during import to correct the misspelt locations.
- If the latitude or longitude columns have any other DMS format other than the supported formats, the data type of those columns will not be automatically identified.
4. How do I set the data type of a column as Geo?

9. What are unresolved locations and from where do I access the list?
When you plot a map chart, sometimes Zoho Analytics might not plot all the data points in the map. This could be due to issues in resolving the geolocation such as duplicated/ambiguous location names, misspelled locations, the colloquial name for places etc.
When Zoho Analytics is not able to identify a location, it lists it as an Unresolved Location(s) for the user to rectify the issue. You can find the list of unresolved locations by:
From a Table
Right-clicking the geo column from your table and select Set Geo Hierarchy from the drop-down.
From a Map Chart
Clicking the Unresolved Location(s) icon that appears in the Map toolbar when you mouse over the chart in the Edit Mode.
10. I have created a map chart but there are some unresolved locations, how do I resolve them?
Unresolved locations as mentioned in the previous question are geo locations (places) that Zoho Analytics is not able to identify. You can help Zoho Analytics to resolve them, by providing the required/missing information, as described in the below steps.
Resolving through Geo Column Mapping
Mapping it to a country column: This will allow Zoho Analytics to identify the country in which the unresolved place is located and plot it appropriately. If you have a country column in your data set, you can map it to resolve the unresolved locations.
In case you do not have a country column, but all the state/cities belong to a single country, you can use Provide the Location option and enter the name of the country.
Mapping it to a state column: This is in addition to mapping the location to a country column. If your dataset contains a state column further mapping it to a state column will help Zoho Analytics identify the state in which the unresolved location is located.
In case you do not have a state column, but all the cities belong to a single state, you can enter the name of the state by selecting Provide the Location option as described above in the case of a country.
Note: Alternatively, as mentioned in the previous question, you can resolve these issues from the parent table as well.
Correcting Misspelt Locations
Zoho Analytics will not be able to identify the location if the spelling of the location is not correct. For example., Hong Kong spelled as Hongkong or Brooklyn being spelled as Broklyn.
In this case, we recommend you to correct the spelling either in the original data and then import it into Zoho Analytics or make the necessary corrections in the Zoho Analytics table.
Plotting the Latitude and Longitude
You can also resolve the issues by specifying the latitude and the longitude values of the corresponding location in the unresolved locations page.
Pick the Location
You can also pick the location by clicking the Pick Location link. Search the location in the map using the given search field. Place the picker in the correct geolocation in the map and click Apply. The latitude and the longitude values for the selected location will be auto-filled in the respective fields.

Creating Geo Charts with Image Background
1. What are geo charts with image background?
In Zoho Analytics, you can blend geo data points (XY coordinates and geo locations) with images to create geo charts with image background. This way you can provide more context to the data being analyzed and gain deeper insights.
Say, you want to analyze a sports team's performance. The team's performance data plotted on the layout of the field/court will provide deeper insights than simply analyzing it as a table or a chart. The below chart illustrates the performance analysis of the basketball team, the Los Angeles Lakers in one of the games.
The below chart is a geo chart with image background that illustrates apparel sales based on brand.
2. What type of data values can be visualized in geo charts with image backgrounds?
You can plot geo data types (both coordinate values and geo locations) over an image.
Coordinate Values (XY) - The coordinate data points are image-specific location points. Say, you want to analyze the floor plan of a construction site. You will have the coordinate values that map to a particular floor plan. Using the geo charts with image background option, you can plot the coordinate values with the corresponding floor plan.
If you do not have the coordinate values of the image being analyzed, you can encode the same from third-party tools like make sense and use the generated values to create geo charts with image backgrounds in Zoho Analytics.
Geo-Location (Lat/Lng) - You can use the geo charts with image background to visualize your geolocation information (say, country, county, city, etc., or latitude and longitude points) over an image.
3. What are the image types supported in geo charts with image background?
Zoho Analytics supports images in .jpeg, .jpg, and .png formats. Ensure that your data tables have the relevant coordinate/geo data points for the images that you are planning to use.
4. How to create geo charts with image background for coordinate values?
The coordinate values are image-specific location points. You can create geo charts with image background if your data tables contain the coordinate values (XY) of the corresponding image that you are planning to use. The below illustration is created with coordinate values corresponding to the human body parts to analyze the apparel sales based on their brands
Let us see how to create the above geo chart with image background.
- From your workspace explorer, click Create > Chart View and select the data table on which you want to create the chart in the Select Base Table dialog. Alternatively, you can also click Create > New Chart from the required data table. You will get navigated to the chart Design Area.
