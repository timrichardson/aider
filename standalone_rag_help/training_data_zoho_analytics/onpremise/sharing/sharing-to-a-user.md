Yes, the users can share the created views with administrators, if the Share View/ Child reports permission is provided by the administrators. Refer to the sharing views section to learn more.
Views shared by users will be listed under the Shared Views folder for administrators, along with the name of the user who shared each report.
When removing a user from the organization, administrators can choose how to handle the views shared by that user. The following are the available options.
- Transfer the views to the Account Admin, giving them full data access.
- Permanently delete the shared views.
7. Is it possible to configure permissions while sharing a view?
Zoho Analytics allows you to set fine-grained permissions while sharing views, such that users can perform only the allowed operations over the shared views. The below presentation provides a detailed explanation about sharing permissions.
8. Is it possible to edit the permissions provided while sharing?
There are three ways to edit the permissions configured for your shared views in Zoho Analytics.
To edit the permissions provided to a specific user,
- Click the Share button in the Explorer, and select the Edit Shared Details by Users option.
- In the Existing Shared Details popup that appears, navigate to the required user and expand their details. This lists all the views shared with the user
- Click the Edit icon that appears on mouse over the required view, modify the permissions as required, and click OK.
To edit the permission configured for a specific report, dashboard or table,
- Open the required view, click the Share icon on the top right corner, and select the Edit Shared Details option.
- The Existing Shared Details popup appears, listing every user the view is shared with. Click the Edit icon that appears on mouse over the required user, modify the permissions as required, and click OK.
You can also access this page by selecting the required views from the Explorer page, clicking the Share icon and selecting the Edit Shared Details by Views option.
9. How do I filter data while sharing a view?
Zoho Analytics allows you to filter the data you share, providing the flexibility to share only the required information in a table, report or dashboard.
Refer the following presentation to know more.
10. How does the Apply Parent Table Filter Criteria option work?
Zoho Analytics allows you to apply a parent table's filter criteria to the reports and dashboards created over the table by selecting the Apply Parent Table Filter Criteria option in the Filter Criteria tab. If you have already shared the parent table to a user with a specific filter criteria, this option allows you to share the dependent reports and dashboards with the same criteria applied over them.
Note:
- When applying the parent table's filter criteria over reports, the parent table's filter criteria and the report's filter criteria will be combined with the AND operation.
- When applying the parent table's filter criteria over dashboards, the parent table's criteria will be combined with both the dashboard's overall filter criteria and the filters specified for the embedded reports.
11. What is a variable?
Variables are placeholders that help administrators assign dynamic values for individual users of the workspace. You can use variables in the Filter criteria section, while sharing reports and dashboards. You can create custom variables, or use the default ones provided by Zoho Analytics. To learn more about creating custom variables, click here. To learn more about the available default variables, refer this question.
Note: Variables are specific to each workspace and cannot be used across workspaces.
12. What are the default variables in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics provides a set of predefined system variables that you can use in your filter criteria. They are listed below.
