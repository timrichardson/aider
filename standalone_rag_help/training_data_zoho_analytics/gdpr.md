GDPR Compliance in Zoho Analytics
The European Union has taken a monumental step in protecting the fundamental right to privacy for every EU resident with the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) effective from May 25, 2018. Simply put, EU residents will now have greater say over what, how, why, where, and when their personal data is used, processed, or disposed. This rule clarifies how the EU personal data laws apply even beyond the borders of the EU. This applies to the data of all the residents of the European Union.
At Zoho Analytics, we have always honored our users' right to data privacy and protection. Over the years, we have demonstrated our commitment to data privacy and protection by constantly meeting and exceeding industry standards. Our compliance with ISO 27001:2013 and SOC 2 Type II is an effort towards this. We have no need to collect and process usersâ€™ personal information beyond what is required for the functioning of Zoho Analytics, and this will never change. We have a privacy-conscious culture here and GDPR is an opportunity for us to strengthen this even further.

Marking Personal Data
Zoho Analytics allows you to mark columns as Personally Identifiable Information (PII). This could be any information that could potentially identify an individual, for example. Name, Email, Job role and Company name etc. When a column is marked as PII, additional care will be taken in handling such data. The data will be encrypted and saved in our servers. The below-animated image shows how to mark a column as PII.
Alternatively, you can also click the Edit Design button in the toolbar and change the value of the corresponding Column Name to 'Yes' under the PII column.
