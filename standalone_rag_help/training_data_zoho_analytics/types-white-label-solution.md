Types of White Label Solutions
Zoho Analytics makes analytics easy for independent software vendors, solution developers, business consultants etc by providing integrated analytics into their product or solution offering. There are two types of White Label solutions that we currently offer.
Standalone/Portal based White Label Solution
Implementing this option will enable you to set up an analytics portal that allows your clients to access the reports that you create as well as build ad-hoc reports on top of what is offered as default by you.
Implementing this solution will enable you to,
- Create a Custom portal for reporting
- Completely customizable login page, header, and logo
- Powerful, highly interactive and insightful visualizations
- Collaborative Analysis
- Easy User management with fine grained control
- Ad-hoc reporting and instant analytics for end users
This option will be of great use for
- Independent software vendors (who would want an online reporting/dashboard service accessible from anywhere anytime)
- Companies from all verticals/industries (sales and marketing, hospitality, real estate, manufacturing, automotive etc) who are emailing reports as attachments to their clients
- Analysts having lots of data to be reported upon/analyzed

Embedded Analytics (With Single Sign On)
This option is meant for SaaS providers. If you have an application offered as SaaS (Software as a Service) and want to offer a powerful reporting solution to go with the service, this would be a perfect choice.
Users can log in to your service, and click on a ‘Reports’ or 'Analytics' tab/link within your service. This will open a white labeled, embedded Zoho Analytics screen seamlessly within your service itself, without requiring your users to log in again separately into Zoho Analytics.
Implementing this solution will enable you to,
- Seamlessly integrate with your application using single sign on API and SAML
- Powerful, highly interactive and insightful visualizations
- A completely API driven process to automate the whole system
- Ad-hoc reporting and instant analytics for end users
- Quick Deployment
