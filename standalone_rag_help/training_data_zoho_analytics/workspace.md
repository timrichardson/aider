Workspace
Workspaces are where you create and manage all your views for reporting and analysis. This allows you to logically group your data sets (stored in entities called Tables) and create insightful reports and Dashboard over your data. Further, it provides various methods to collaborate with other users. The Workspace also contains structural information on how the entities are related to each other.
