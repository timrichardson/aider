In Zoho Analytics, you can customize node and link colors, adjusting them individually or globally, and set link colors based on source or target nodes. You can choose a basic Sankey chart for simple flows or an Alluvial Chart for complex, multi-stage flows.
- Racing charts are animated views that are best suited for visualizing the changes in the data over a period of time where the relative ranking of categories is important. They highlight and help comprehend the fluctuations and progression in the data. These types of charts grab the user's attention instantly, providing an immersive experience and helping craft a compelling story about the data.
- Spark lines are compact charts that show the trends and variations in the data without taking up much space.

The size of each arc in the ring is proportional to the value of the data.
- Conversion bar charts show the connected stages of a process and the gradual decrease in data as it moves through different stages of the process. Each stage is represented by a bar, with a step or stair case pattern indicating the shift in values (along with conversion percentage) at each stage.
