In Zoho Analytics, a row or record is defined in the same context as in a database (or spreadsheet). In simple terms, a table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row in a table represents a set of related data that has the same structure.
For example, In the Tickets table, each row would represent a single tickets' record such as created at, resolved at, due date, resolution time etc. The number of rows calculated for pricing is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your Workspace tables in your Zoho Analytics account.
