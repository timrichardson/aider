Pricing & Trial
1. How much does this connector cost?
To use the Zoho Analytics Advanced Analytics Connector for Salesforce, you need to purchase a paid plan of Zoho Analytics (Refer to the Zoho Analytics pricing page).
Refer to the following document to know how to subscribe to a paid plan.
2. Do you provide trial evaluation for this connector?
Yes, we do provide a 15-day free trial for this connector from the date of setup.
3. What do you mean by 'Users' in the (connector) pricing plan?
Anyone to whom you privately share your Workspaces, tables (data), reports and dashboards, created in Zoho Analytics, for collaboration is considered a "User" in Zoho Analytics. A user is identified by his/her unique email address, with which their Zoho Analytics account was created/registered.
Suppose you subscribe to the Zoho Analytics Standard plan, you can privately share the data/reports in your account and collaborate with 4 other persons. Now your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users (including yourself).

In Zoho Analytics, a row or record is defined in the same context as in a database (or spreadsheet). In simple terms, a table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row in a table represents a set of related data and has the same structure. For example, in a table that represents "Contacts", each row would represent a single contact record. The number of rows calculated for pricing is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your workspace tables in your Zoho Analytics account.

8. How do I create my own custom formulas in Zoho Analytics?
Refer to the Adding Formulas in Zoho Analytics help page.

10. Can I add new columns to the Salesforce tabs (tables) from within Zoho Analytics?
No, you cannot add new columns. But you can add Formula Columns and Aggregate Formulas (i.e. Calculated fields) to these tables to help you create powerful reports. Refer Adding Formulas in Zoho Analytics to know more.
11. Can I add new data tables in this Workspace to create reports & dashboards?
Yes, you can add new data tables. Click New > New Table and you can add new tables to the existing Salesforce Workspace.
With this feature, you can import new data or add them manually into your Workspace to analyze and create reports combining this with the Salesforce data.

Refer:
- How to Import data from Files and Feeds
- How to Import data from Cloud Storage
- How to Import data from local databases using Upload tool
12.Can I combine data from other sources with the data from Salesforce CRM to create reports and dashboards?
Yes, you can combine data from your other sources with your CRM data for analysis.
To do this, you need to add/import a new data table into the Salesforce CRM Workspace and then define a look-up to join it with the synchronized table from Salesforce CRM.
To define a lookup relationship between two tables, it is essential that the tables have at least one column which is common between them. Follow the below steps to look up a column from Salesforce CRM along with the data from any other source.
- Open the corresponding table, right click the column header and select Change to Lookup Column.
- In the Change to Lookup Column dialog that opens, select the column to look up.
- Click Ok
Please do note that you can create Lookup only to columns in the tables that are not from the same data source.
13. What are Query Tables?
Zoho Analytics allow you to pull the data required by writing standard SQL SELET Queries. This feature is called Query Tables. With Query Tables, you can also combine data from different tables and create reports from the same. View this demo video to know about how to create Query Tables in Zoho Analytics.
14. Can I join data from multiple tables to create reports?
Yes, you can join data from multiple tables to create the reports. Refer to Joining Tables in Zoho Analytics for detailed help on this.
Users, Sharing & Collaboration
1. How do I share the reports in Zoho Analytics with my colleagues?
You can share the default reports provided in the Zoho Analytics connector and also the reports you create, with your organization co-employees/colleagues. Refer to Sharing and Collaboration
Once you privately share a report to your colleagues, they will be able to access the same from Shared Database tab.
Note:
1. If you share the data tables in the Salesforce Workspace to users, they will be able to create their own reports over the same.
2. If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the Salesforce Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Multiple Workspace Administrator in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able to access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace, except deleting the workspace & editing the Salesforce integration setup.
2. Why are other members in my organization not able to access the reports created?
The tables and reports will be available only to the users who configures the Zoho Analytics connector, by default. The other members of the organization will be able to access it only when the 'Salesforce Analytics' workspace shared. Let's say the Administrator has shared the workspace with other members in the organization. And a member creates his/her own reports. Those reports will be available only to him/her alone, unless he/she shares them with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my organization create reports?
Other menbers in the organization can create reports when the user who setup the connector share the tables present in 'Salesforce Analytics' workspace with them. Once this is done, the shared users can create reports based on those tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
Note:
If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the Salesforce Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Multiple Workspace Administrator, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace, except deleting the workspace & editing the Salesforce integration setup.
4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics supports fine-grained access control. The following are are user roles that are supported in Zoho Analytics:
1. Administrator (Master Admin): The Zoho Analytics user who had setup the Salesforce integration will also be the administrator of the Zoho Analytics account
2. Workspace Administrator: The Administrator can designate one or more users as Workspace Administrators. A Workspace Administrator has all permissions to add, delete, modify reports, table rows and even tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the workspace tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a workspace.
3. User: A user has the least privilege in the hierarchy. Unless the Administrator or a Workspace Administrator shares a table with a user, the user cannot create any reports on his/her own. Also, an Administrator/Workspace Administrator can decide to set specific permissions when sharing a report (Read Only, Export Data, View Underlying Data, Share with Others) or a table (Read Data, Export Data, Add/Delete/Modify Row, Delete All Rows, Only Append Rows, Add or Update Rows, Delete All Rows and Add New Rows, Share View / Child Reports).
Refer to Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know more about different user roles in Zoho Analytics. Also, refer to help page.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. If the user being shared to is a Workspace Administrator, he/she can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit report, what he/she can do is to use Save As to save the report in a different name in his account. This report can then be edited.
6. Can I share the same report created, to multiple users with different criteria associated so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to this help documentation section to know how this can be done.
