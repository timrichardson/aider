3. What do you mean by 'Users' in the (connector) pricing plan?
Anyone with whom you privately share your Workspace, tables (data), reports and dashboards, created in Zoho Analytics for collaboration is considered a 'User' in Zoho Analytics. A user is identified by their unique email address, that they used to register/create their Zoho Analytics account.
Suppose you subscribe to the Zoho Analytics Standard plan, you can privately share the data/reports in your account and collaborate with 4 other people. Now your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users (including yourself).
4. What do you mean by 'Rows'/'Records' and how is it calculated in the pricing plan?
In Zoho Analytics, a row or record is defined in the same context as in a database (or spreadsheet). In simple terms, a table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row in a table represents a set of related data and has the same structure.
For example, in a table for a Campaign, each row would represent a single record. The number of rows calculated for pricing is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your Workspace tables in your Zoho Analytics account.
