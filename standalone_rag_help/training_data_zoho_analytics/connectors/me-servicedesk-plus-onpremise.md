Yes, you can combine data from your other sources with your SDP data for analysis.
To do this, you need to add/import a new data table into the SDP Workspace and then define a look-up to join it with the synchronized table from Google Analytics.
To define a lookup relationship between two tables, it is essential that the tables have at least one column which is common between them. Follow the below steps to look up a column from SDP along with the data from any other source.
- Open the corresponding table, right click the column header and select Change to Lookup Column.
- In the Change to Lookup Column dialog that opens, select the column to look up.
- Click Ok
Please do note that you can create Lookup only to columns in the tables that are not from the same data source.
13. What are Query Tables?
Zoho Analytics allow you to pull the data required by writing standard SQL SELECT Queries. This feature is called Query Tables. With Query Tables you can also combine data from different tables and create reports from the same. View this demo video to know about how to create Query Tables in Zoho Analytics.
14. Can I join data from multiple tables to create reports?
Yes, you can join data from multiple tables to create the reports. Refer to Joining Tables in Zoho Analytics for detailed help on this.
15. How do I generate a bookmark URL or permalink for a report or dashboard?
Zoho Analytics allows you to have a (semi-) private link for any report or dashboard. Click the Publish icon -> URL / Permalink for this view. To know more, refer to the Creating URL/Permalink to Views.
Users, Sharing & Collaboration
1. How do I share the reports in Zoho Analytics with my colleagues?
You can share the default reports provided in the Zoho Analytics connector and also the reports you create, with your organization employees/colleagues. Refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page for more.
Once you privately share a report to your colleagues they will be able to access the same as you do, following the steps below:
- User logs in to SDP.
- Select the Reports tab > Zoho Analytics.
- Clicking the link will open the ME ServiceDesk Plus On-Premises Analytics Workspace in a new browser tab. They will be prompted to log into their Zoho Analytics account, incase they are not already logged-in.
- Users will be able access the reports & data shared to them.
1. If you share the data tables in the SDP Workspace to users, they will be able to create their own reports over the same.
2. If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the SDP Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
2. Why are other members in my organization not able to access the reports created?
When the SDP Administrator configures the SDP - Zoho Analytics connector, the tables and reports will be available only to him/her, by default. The Administrator has to share the 'ME ServiceDesk On-Premises Plus Analytics' workspace with other members of the organization. Only then will the default reports be accessible by those members.
There could be a another case where say the Administrator has shared the workspace with other members in the organization. And the member creates his/her own reports. Those reports will be available only to him/her alone, unless he/she shares them with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my organization create reports?
The SDP Administrator who setup the connector should share the tables present in ME ServiceDesk Plus On-Premises Analytics workspace with other members of the organization. Once this is done, the shared users can create reports based on those tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the SDP Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics supports fine-grained access control. The following are are user roles that are supported in Zoho Analytics:
1. Administrator (Master Admin): The User account in Zoho Analytics who had setup the connector will be the administrator of the Zoho Analytics account
2. Workspace Administrator: The Administrator can designate one or more users as Workspace Administrators. A Workspace Administrator has all permissions to add, delete, modify reports, table rows and even tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the workspace tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a workspace.
3. User: A user has the least privilege in the hierarchy. He/She can access the reports, dashboards & tables which are shared to them by the Administrator/Workspace Administrator. Users can access the shared information only by log-in into his/her account in Zoho Analytics. Unless the Administrator or a Workspace Administrator shares a table with a User, the user cannot create any reports on his/her own. Also, an Administrator/Workspace Administrator can decide to set specific permissions when sharing a report (Read Only, Export Data, View Underlying Data, Share with Others) or a table (Read Data, Export Data, Add/Delete/Modify Rows, Share View / Child Reports).
Refer to Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know more about different user roles in Zoho Analytics. Also refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. If the user being shared to is a Workspace Administrator, he/she can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit report, what he/she can do is to use 'Save As' to save the report in a different name in his account. This report can then be edited.
6. Can I share the same report created, to multiple users with different criteria associated so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to this help documentation section to know how this can be done.
