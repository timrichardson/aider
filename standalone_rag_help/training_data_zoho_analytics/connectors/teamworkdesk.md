1. How much does this connector cost?
This Teamwork Desk Advanced Analytics is available in all the paid plans of Zoho Analytics. Users in the free plan can evaluate this functionality by subscribing to a free 15 day trial (no credit cards required).
2. What do you mean by 'Users' in the pricing plan?
Anyone to whom you privately share your databases, tables (data), reports and dashboards, created in Zoho Analytics, for collaboration is considered a 'User' in Zoho Analytics. A user is identified by his/her unique email address, with which their Zoho Analytics account was registered.
Suppose you subscribe to the Zoho Analytics Standard plan, you can privately share the data/reports in your account and collaborate with 4 other persons. Now your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users (including yourself). Click to know more about the Zoho Analytics user model.
3. What do you mean by 'Rows' and how is it calculated in the pricing plan?
In Zoho Analytics, a row or record is defined in the same context as in a database (or spreadsheet). In simple terms, a table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row in a table represents a set of related data and has the same structure. For example, in a table that represents "Invoices", each row would represent a single invoice record. The number of rows calculated for pricing, is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your database tables in your Zoho Analytics account.
