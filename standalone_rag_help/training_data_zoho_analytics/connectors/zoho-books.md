9. How do I create my own custom formulas in Zoho Analytics?
You can also add your own formulas to derive your own calculations in Zoho Analytics. To know how to create your own formulas refer to the Adding Formulas in Zoho Analytics help page.
10. Can I join data from multiple tables to create reports?
Yes, you can join data from multiple tables to create the reports. Refer to Joining Tables in Zoho Analytics for detailed help on this.
11. What are Query Tables?
Zoho Analytics allows you to drive the data required by writing standard SQL SELECT Queries. This feature is called Query Tables. With Query Tables, you can also combine data from different tables and create reports from the same. View the create Query Tables in Zoho Analytics video to know more.
Users, Sharing & Collaboration
1. How do I share the reports in Zoho Analytics with my colleagues?
You can easily share the default reports provided in the Zoho Analytics connector and also the reports you create using the share option. Refer to Sharing and Collaboration video to learn more.
Once you privately share a report to your colleagues they will be able to access the same from the Zoho Analytics service.
Note:
- If you share the data tables in the Zoho Finance Advanced Analytics Workspace to users, they will be able to create their own reports over the same.
- If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the Zoho Finance Advanced Analytics Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrator), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
2. Why are other members in my organization not able to access the reports created?
When a Zoho Finance Administrator configures the Zoho Finance - Zoho Analytics connector, the tables and reports will be available only to him/her, by default. The Administrator has to share the 'Zoho Finance Advanced Analytics' workspace with other members of the organization. Only then will the default reports be accessible by those members. Let's say the Administrator has shared the Workspace with other members in the organization. A member creates his/her own reports. Those reports will be available only to him/her alone unless he/she shares them with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my organization create reports?
The Zoho Finance Administrator who has setup the connector should share the tables present in Zoho Finance Advanced Analytics workspace with other members of the organization. Once this is done, the shared users can create reports based on those tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics offers three user roles - Account Administrator, Workspace Administrator, and User. Click to know more about the Zoho Analytics Organization Model and User Roles.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. If the user being shared to is a Workspace Administrator, he/she can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit a report, what he/she can do is to use Save As to save the report in a different name in his account. This report can then be edited.
6. Can I share the same report created to multiple users with different criteria associated, so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to Apply filter criteria help documentation to know how this can be done.
7. Can I export a report/dashboard?
Yes, you can export the report/dashboard in various file formats such as CSV, EXCEL, PDF, HTML and Image. Click to know more.
8. How can I print the reports & dashboards created in Zoho Analytics?

9. How can I email reports & dashboards created in Zoho Analytics in a scheduled manner?
If you are the Administrator of the Zoho Analytics connector or a Workspace Administrator, you can schedule reports and dashboards to be emailed automatically. Refer to the email schedule help documentation.
10. How do I embed my reports in my intranet, blog, or presentation?
You can easily embed the reports & dashboards created in Zoho Analytics in your website, web application, or blog. Refer Embedding in Web Pages/Blogs to know more about this.

You can customize the lookups between the Zoho CRM and Zoho Finance organization data tables if required.
- To customize the lookups, click the Customize link next to the Data Blending: Zoho CRM is automatically connected with Zoho Finance checkbox.
The Blend Data - Customize Lookups page will list all the possible lookup relations available. You can add a lookup relation by selecting the corresponding checkbox.
Note: When you select a lookup relation, the modules and fields respective to the lookup will also get added automatically.- Click Create to set up the connector.
Once the setup is completed, the Zoho Finance data will be imported into your Zoho CRM Advanced Analytics workspace. A set of reports and dashboards will be created automatically in Zoho Analytics by default. You can also manually create reports combining the modules of both Zoho CRM and Zoho Finance as desired.
Note:
- You need setup the Zoho Finance connector in the same workspace where Zoho CRM connector is setup. If you have already setup the Zoho Finance connector in a separate workspace, you need to delete it.
- The relational look ups is created between Zoho CRM modules and the modules that are common in all the Zoho Finance apps.
5. Can I integrate multiple Zoho Finance organizations with Zoho CRM in Zoho Analytics?
Data blending is yet to be supported for multiple organizations' data.
As of now, you can blend data from only one Zoho Finance organization with Zoho CRM in Zoho Analytics. It is not possible to link multiple organizations from one data source to another data source in Zoho Analytics.
