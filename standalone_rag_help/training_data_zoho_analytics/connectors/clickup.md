In any of the above mentioned cases, the data sync will be paused. You will be notified via email and in-app notification with the exact reason for failure along with the solution.
To resolve the sync failure, delete or restructure the views, or restore the specific modules and fields from the source application. Refer to Data Sync failure and solutions article for more details.
