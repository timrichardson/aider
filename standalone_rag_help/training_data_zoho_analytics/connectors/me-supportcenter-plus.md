The free trial will enable you to try the connector in the "Standard" plan of Zoho Analytics (Refer to the Zoho Analytics pricing page). You can continue to use the connector even after the trial period, in the "Free" plan of Zoho Analytics.
3. What do you mean by 'Users' in the (connector) pricing plan?
Anyone to whom you privately share your workspace, tables (data), reports and dashboards, created in Zoho Analytics, for collaboration is considered a "User" in Zoho Analytics. A user is identified by his/her unique email address, with which their Zoho Analytics account was created/registered.
Suppose you subscribe to the Zoho Analytics Standard plan, you can privately share the data/reports in your account and collaborate with 4 other persons. Now your Zoho Analytics account is said to have 5 users (including yourself).
4. What do you mean by 'Rows' and how is it calculated in the pricing plan?
In Zoho Analytics, a row or record is defined in the same context as in a database (or spreadsheet). In simple terms, a table consists of rows (records) and columns (fields). Each row in a table represents a set of related data and has the same structure. For example, in a table that represents "Requests", each row would represent a single request record. The number of rows calculated for pricing, is the sum of all rows/records stored across all your workspace tables in your Zoho Analytics account.

To do this, you need to add/import a new data table into the SCP Workspace and then define a look-up to join it with the synchronized table from SCP.
To define a lookup relationship between two tables, it is essential that the tables have at least one column which is common between them. Follow the below steps to look up a column from SCP along with the data from any other source.
- Open the corresponding table, right click the column header and select Change to Lookup Column.

Zoho Analytics allows you to have a (semi-) private link for any report or dashboard. Click the Publish icon -> URL / Permalink for this view.
To bookmark the URL for the report/dashboard, get the URL for the 'without login' option.
The report link has a unique privatelink key as a part of it.
You can bookmark the above URL for accessing the report/dashboard any time.
If you want a more secure link, use the 'with login' option. This will ask for the users to log into their Zoho Analytics account and will be accessible only if you had shared the report to them.
To know more, refer to the Creating URL/Permalink to Views help doc page.
Users, Sharing & Collaboration
1. How do I share the reports in Zoho Analytics with my colleagues?
You can share the default reports provided in the Zoho Analytics connector and also the reports you create, with your organization employees/colleagues. Refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page for more.
Once you privately share a report to your colleagues they will be able to access the same as you do, following the steps below:
- User logs in to SCP.
- Select the Reports tab > Zoho Analytics.
- Clicking the link will open the ME SupportCenter Plus Analytics Workspace in a new browser tab. They will be prompted to log into their Zoho Analytics account, incase they are not already logged-in.
- Users will be able access the reports & data shared to them.
1. If you share the data tables in the SCP Workspace to users, they will be able to create their own reports over the same.
2. If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the SCP Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
2. Why are other members in my organization not able to access the reports created?
When the SCP Administrator configures the SCP - Zoho Analytics connector, the tables and reports will be available only to him/her, by default. The Administrator has to share the 'ME SupportCenter Plus Analytics' workspace with other members of the organization. Only then will the default reports be accessible by those members.
There could be a another case where say the Administrator has shared the workspace with other members in the organization. And the member creates his/her own reports. Those reports will be available only to him/her alone, unless he/she shares them with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my organization create reports?
The SCP Administrator who setup the connector should share the tables present in ME SupportCenter Plus Analytics workspace with other members of the organization. Once this is done, the shared users can create reports based on those tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
If you add a user as a Workspace Administrator in the SCP Workspace created in Zoho Analytics (Refer Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know how to add Workspace Administrators), the user will be able access all the data & reports, create new reports and do any operation that you could do on the Workspace.
4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics supports fine-grained access control. The following are are user roles that are supported in Zoho Analytics:
1. Administrator (Master Admin): The User account in Zoho Analytics who had setup the connector will be the administrator of the Zoho Analytics account
2. Workspace Administrator: The Administrator can designate one or more users as Workspace Administrators. A Workspace Administrator has all permissions to add, delete, modify reports, table rows and even tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the workspace tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a workspace.
3. User: A user has the least privilege in the hierarchy. He/She can access the reports, dashboards & tables which are shared to them by the Administrator/Workspace Administrator. Users can access the shared information only by log-in into his/her account in Zoho Analytics. Unless the Administrator or a Workspace Administrator shares a table with a User, the user cannot create any reports on his/her own. Also, an Administrator/Workspace Administrator can decide to set specific permissions when sharing a report (Read Only, Export Data, View Underlying Data, Share with Others) or a table (Read Data, Export Data, Add/Delete/Modify Rows, Share View / Child Reports).
Refer to Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know more about different user roles in Zoho Analytics. Also refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. If the user being shared to is a Workspace Administrator, he/she can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit report, what he/she can do is to use 'Save As' to save the report in a different name in his account. This report can then be edited.
6. Can I share the same report created, to multiple users with different criteria associated so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to this help documentation section to know how this can be done.
