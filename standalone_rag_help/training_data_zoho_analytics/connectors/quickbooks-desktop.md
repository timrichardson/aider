Troubleshooting Tips
1. I get an error message as "A QuickBooks company data file is already open and it is different from the one requested." How to resolve this?
The following are the possible causes that can result in this error.
Case 1: You have two instances of QuickBooks open on the same machine.
Solution: Run only one instance & close all other instances.
Case 2: You have the Quick Start option turned on.
Solution: Turn off this option.
Case 3: Different QuickBooks File is open. You have QuickBooks open to a particular company file other than the one you had originally set up in the Zoho Analytics Setup Creation Configuration page.

Solution: Ensure that the file specified in Zoho Analytics Setup page and the one that is opened are same using the Edit Setup option.
Case 4: Different QuickBooks Path. You have QuickBooks open to a particular company file that is using a different path than the one you had originally set up in the Qube Configuration Tool.
