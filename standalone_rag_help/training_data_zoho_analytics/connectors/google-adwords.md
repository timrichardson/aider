Once you privately share a report to your colleagues they will be able to access the reports as you do. Refer here to know how to access the reports.
2. Why are other members not able to access the reports created?
When you configure the Google Ads - Zoho Analytics connector, the tables and reports will be available only to you. You have to share the 'Google Ads' workspace with other members of the organization for them to view it. Only then will the default reports be accessible by those members.
There could be another case where you shared the workspace with other members in the organization. And the member creates his/her own reports. Those reports will not be available to others, unless he/she shares them with others.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
3. How can other members in my organization create reports?
The Google Ads user who set up the connector should share the tables present in Google Ads workspace with other members of the organization. Once this is done, the shared users will be able to create reports based on those tables.
To know more, refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
4. What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
There are three different user roles in Zoho Analytics. Refer to the topic User Roles in Zoho Analytics from the Manage Users help documentation.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. If the user being shared to is a Workspace Administrator, he/she can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit report, what he/she can do is to use the Save As icon to save the report in a different name in his account. He can then modify the newly saved file.
6. Can I share the same report created, to multiple users with different criteria associated so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to this help documentation section to know how this can be done.
7. How can I print the reports & dashboards created in Zoho Analytics?

- If you are a user to whom a report has been shared and you want to take a print, ensure you have been provided the Export permission by the Administrator to the report, only then you will be able to print the report.

If you are the Administrator of the Zoho Analytics connector or a 'Workspace Administrator', you can schedule reports and dashboards to be emailed automatically. Refer to this help documentation to know more about the emailing feature.
9. How can I export the reports & dashboards created in Zoho Analytics?
