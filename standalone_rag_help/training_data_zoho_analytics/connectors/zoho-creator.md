To manually create a lookup relationship refer this help link - https://www.zoho.com/analytics/help/table/joining-tables.html
Solutions
1. I imported the data from my Zoho Creator application into Zoho Analytics. But, one/some of the columns have random ID values instead of the actual values. What should I do?
This scenario will occur when the data imported from the Zoho Creator application contains forms that are linked using a lookup column (in Zoho Creator).
When such an application is synced with Zoho Analytics, unique internal ids are created for the lookup columns (child column). These internal ids are linked to the corresponding value in the parent column.
In the below example we have imported 2 forms from Zoho Creator.
- Course Registration form - This form collects the applicant's details such as email, age and the course that they are registering for.
- Course Upgrade form - This form contains the email address of the registered applicant and the course name that he wishes to upgrade to.
Both these forms are linked to each other using the Email column.
Shown below is the "Course Registration" form.
And, this is the "Course Upgrade" form.
In the Course Upgrade form, the Email column does not contain the email ids of the applicants. Instead, it contains internally created identification numbers. This is because the column Email is a lookup column. It is linked to the Email column in the "Course Registration" table.
Let us now see how to create reports using the Course Registration and the Course upgrade tables.
We going to create a Pivot to view the email address of the applicant, the course that they initially opted for and the course that they are upgrading to.
Drag and drop the following columns in the Pivot designer.
- Email column from Course Registration table
- Course Interested from Course Registration table
- Upgrade Course to from Course Upgrade table
Note:
- In case you have not imported the parent form, you can do it by editing the setup and adding the corresponding fields. Refer to this question to learn how.
- It is mandatory that you use the parent columns while creating reports.
- Forms that are linked to each other using a lookup feature in Zoho Creator, will automatically be linked in Zoho Analytics as well.
2. Can I create a form in Zoho Creator which will directly add the data into Zoho Analytics?
Yes, you can easily create a data entry form to directly fetch the data fed into the form by easily mapping the fields in the Zoho Creator form with the corresponding columns in Zoho Analytics. Refer to this help link to learn more.
3. Does Zoho Analytics offer Embedded Analytics or rebranding?
Yes, Zoho Analytics supports various rebranding options such as Portal rebranding/white labeling and Logo Rebranding.
