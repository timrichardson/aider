Backup
Zoho Analytics allows you to back up the data available in each of your workspace. Database Backup option will backup the data from tables and SQL queries from query tables and make it available for download. The reports and dashboards are not backed up. You can use this feature if you want to have a local copy of your data.
Note
- This option is only available in Standard, Premium and Enterprise plans.
- Zoho Analytics runs on redundant network devices to avoid any single point of failure at any level on the internal network.
- User data is backed-up periodically across multiple servers, helping protect the data in the event of hardware failure or disaster. Hence, your data will remain safe on our servers. In the case of any unforced system issues, we would help you to restore your data from our end. Click to know more.
- This Backup feature is recommended to be used only if you want to have an archive of your data.
