What are the user roles available in Zoho Analytics?
Zoho Analytics supports fine-grained access control. The following are are user roles that are supported in Zoho Analytics:
1. Administrator (Master Admin): The Zoho Recruit Administrator who had setup the connector will also be the administrator of the Zoho Analytics account
2. Workspace Administrator: The Administrator can designate one or more users as Workspace Administrators. A Workspace Administrator has all permissions to add, delete, modify reports, table rows and even tables. A Workspace Administrator can share the database tables/reports with other users. A Workspace Administrator cannot delete or rename a database.
3. User: A user has the least privilege in the hierarchy. Unless the Administrator or a Workspace Administrator shares a table with a user, the user cannot create any reports on his/her own. Also, an Administrator/Workspace Administrator can decide to set specific permissions when sharing a report (Read Only, Export Data, View Underlying Data, Share with Others) or a table (Read Data, Export Data, Add/Delete/Modify Row, Delete All Rows, Only Append Rows, Add or Update Rows, Delete All Rows and Add New Rows, Share View / Child Reports).
Refer to Managing Users in Zoho Analytics, to know more about different user roles in Zoho Analytics. Also refer to Sharing and Collaboration help page.
5. Why can't other users edit the reports that I have shared to them?
This is the expected behavior. If the user being shared to is a Workspace Administrator, he/she can edit the reports. If a normal user wants to edit report, what he/she can do is to use 'Save As' to save the report in a different name in his account. This report can then be edited.
6. Can I share the same report created, to multiple users with different criteria associated so that they see different data?
Yes, you can. Refer to this help documentation to know how this can be done.
