The users will be able to see the data that you have granted access to. The visibility to the users depends on the permission granted / filters applied by you (Account Administrator, Organization Administrator, or Workspace Administrator). The users will always see the latest version of the Views/Workspace that you have made accessible to them.
Any data or report or dashboard published will always have the latest live version. And the user will see the data that you have granted access. Like, when a report is published with associated filter criteria, then the user accessing this view will only see the filtered data.
