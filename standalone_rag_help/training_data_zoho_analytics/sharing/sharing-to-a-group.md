Sharing to Groups
To enable easy collaboration, Zoho Analytics supports the concept of Groups. You can create a Group which contains a set of users and easily share reports and dashboards with the required permissions as you do for an individual user. You can create any number of Groups in a Workspace for easy collaboration.
Note that Groups created within a Workspace will be applicable only within that particular Workspace.
